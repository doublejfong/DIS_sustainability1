# Module 3: Data Visualization

## Overview
This module delves into the fundamentals of data visualization, focusing on using Streamlit to create interactive charts and FastAPI to handle data retrieval. 
Students will learn to build dynamic visual interfaces and APIs that can fetch and display data efficiently.

## Workflow
### Step 1: Set Up FastAPI for Data Retrieval
First, set up FastAPI to create endpoints for data retrieval.
### Step 2: Set Up Streamlit for Data Visualization
Next, set up Streamlit to create interactive charts.
### Step 3: Integrate Streamlit with FastAPI
Ensure that Streamlit fetches data from the FastAPI endpoint and updates the visualizations accordingly.
### Step 4: Add component or feature 
Enhance the visualizations with more interactivity and customization using Streamlit's built-in features.

## What You Will Learn
- **Data Visualizations**: Learn to create charts with Matplotlib and enhance user interactivity with Streamlit
- **Data Handling**: Learn to retrieve data using FastAPI endpoints which can be seamlessly integrated into Streamlit applications
- **Integration**: Learn to connect Streamlit with FastAPI to enable real-time data updates and create responsive visualizations
