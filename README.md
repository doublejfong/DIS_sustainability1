# Module 1: Data Cleaning

## Overview
This module focuses on preparing data for analysis and calculating key performance indicators (KPIs) that are crucial for assessing environmental efficiency. 
The processes involve data cleaning and computing metrics such as Energy Utilization Index (EUI), Water Efficiency Index (WEI), and Carbon Index.

## Tasks

### Data Cleaning
- Prepare and clean data extracted from Excel files
- Ensure the data is complete and accurate for KPI calculation

### KPI Calculation
- Calculate the following key performance indicators:
  - Energy Utilization Index (EUI)
  - Water Efficiency Index (WEI)
  - Carbon Index
- These indicators are essential for measuring the environmental impact

## What You Will Learn
- **Data Import and Export**:  Gain proficiency in using libraries to load and save data in Excel file
- **Data Cleaning**: Learn to handle missing values, merge multiple datasets and filter data

The results show that 1 m3 of “NEWater at consumer” and 1 m3 of “tap water at consumer” contributes 2.19 kg CO2-Eq and 1.30 kg CO2-Eq to climate change potential, and 0.00344 m3 and 0.882 m3 to water depletion potential respectively.
