# Module 2: Data Forecasting

## Overview
This module explores time series forecasting using LightGBM and AWS Chronos, focusing on training, deploying, and leveraging these tools to achieve high prediction accuracy in handling time-sensitive data.

## Workflow
### Step 1: Calculate the Mean Temperature Data
First, calculate the mean temperature for each month from the weather dataset. This will be one of the features for the model.
### Step 2: Prepare the Training Data
Next, prepare training data by adding the calculated mean temperature column to original dataset.
### Step 3: Train LightGBM Model
Train the LightGBM model using the prepared training data.
### Step 4: Predict data with LightGBM and AWS Chronos
Use the trained LightGBM model and AWS Chronos to predict the data for energy and water.

## What You Will Learn
- **Model Training**: Learn to utilize the LightGBM framework for time series forecasting. The process involves understanding feature selection and model tuning to build a forecasting model.
- **Data Prediction**: Use the trained LightGBM model alongside AWS Chronos to predict future events. Learn to preprocess data, configure and interpret outputs from these tools and apply them to predict data.
