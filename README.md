# Module 3: Data Visualization

## Overview
This module delves into the fundamentals of data visualization, focusing on using Streamlit to create interactive charts and FastAPI to handle data retrieval. 
Students will learn to build dynamic visual interfaces and APIs that can fetch and display data efficiently.

## Objectives
- Develop interactive data visualizations using Streamlit
- Implement FastAPI to retrieve data that feeds into visualizations
- Integrate Streamlit with FastAPI to create a seamless data flow and visualization experience

## What You Will Learn
- **Data Visualizations**: Learn to create charts with Matplotlib and enhance user interactivity with Streamlit
- **Data Handling**: Learn to retrieve data using FastAPI endpoints which can be seamlessly integrated into Streamlit applications
- **Integration**: Learn to connect Streamlit with FastAPI to enable real-time data updates and create responsive visualizations
